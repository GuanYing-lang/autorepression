# Users' Guide

This repository contains example codes in paper 'Mitigating Host Burden of Genetic Circuits by Engineering Autonegatively Regulated Parts and Improving Functional Prediction'. Especially, it includes examples for sensitivity analysis, improved parameter fitting method, predictions of autoregulated switches.

All codes are written in Matlab2017b, and worked fine in Matlab2017b and Matlab2020b.
