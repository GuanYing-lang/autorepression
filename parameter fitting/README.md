Parameter fitting algorithm fitted three parameters (alpha, K, n) of repression curves. The simplex downhill search algorithm was used 'fit' function in Matlab and the RMSE for A16K5 was 171.7. The improved hybrid downhill search algorithm was performed in two procedures. First run 'A16K5.m' to get the original input, then run 'para_trans_fmins.m' to fit parameters.
